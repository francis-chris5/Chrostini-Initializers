# Chrostini-Initializers
One of my favorite features on a Chromebook is the "Powerwash" ability. Very easily return to near-factory reset whenever I want to change the configuration to match the upcoming usage on the machine, and I mostly use the built in virtual Ubuntu desktop known as Chrostini. This repository is some shell scripts to rapidly set that up to the configurations I find myself wanting quite often.


<h2>Full Stack Developer</h2>
My preferred setup for basic web development: Java, Python, PHP, MySQL, Apache test environment, Sublime Text Editor, Firefox, and a number of working/scratch directories and shortcuts.

(still under construction, expect it to be finished before bedtime on the day this repository was created)

(when finished it should be pretty close to just download and run the full-stack.sh bash script and be ready to go --a couple issues to work out from full automation just yet though)

  <h4>Bugs</h4>
  
  The shortcut to ChromeOS Downloads folder didn't work the first time, had to go to Files and right-click -> "open with terminal" before running the script even though the address is correct.
  
  Still had to manually confirm the messages on xampp install, they are from installer not bash, so I could not pass in confirmations in initial script (typing 'y' three times easier than doing a full type of this set up in bash)
