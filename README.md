# Chrostini-Initializers
One of my favorite features on a Chromebook is the "Powerwash" ability. Very easily return to near-factory reset whenever I want to change the configuration to match the upcoming usage on the machine, and I mostly use the built in virtual Ubuntu desktop known as Chrostini. This repository is some shell scripts to rapidly set that up to the configurations I find myself wanting quite often.


<h2>Full Stack Developer</h2>
My preferred setup for basic web development: Java, Python, PHP, MySQL, Apache test environment, Sublime Text Editor, Firefox, and a number of working/scratch directories and shortcuts.
(still under construction, expect it to be finished before bedtime on the day this repository was created)
