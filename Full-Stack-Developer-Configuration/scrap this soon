final portion of this is to get this line:


export PATH="/opt/lampp/bin:~/Documents/Programs/sublime_text_3:$PATH"

into the bottom of .bashrc


some thoughts:
  figure out if I can edit .bashrc from inside a script (doesn't running my script refer to it???)
  python is installed, port (import os.path ... x = readline .... writeline (that stuff) ... print back to file)
  can I just printf>.bashrc ???
  
  
  
probably going to be a few powerwashes to get this going...
